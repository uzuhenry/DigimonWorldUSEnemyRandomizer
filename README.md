# DigimonWorldUSEnemyRandomizer
A temporary standalone enemy randomizer for Digimon World US versions

##IMPORTANT: the data files on the repo are the most up to date, it is recommended to use those files instead of the ones bundled in the rar.

This is a trial version until i cand do a proper pull request on syd rando to integrate it.
If you find any crash or problem submit your spoiler log in an issue.

This should work on randomized versions of the game for a full randomized run, but haven't tested it properly so it may broke.
